1. TypeScript is an open-source pure object-oriented programming language. It is a strongly     typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript.It is not directly run on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile and generate in JavaScript file. TypeScript source file is in ".ts" extension. We can use any valid ".js" file by renaming it to ".ts" file.

Differences between TypeScript are:

1. Javascript doesn't support strongly typed or static typing where typescriptsupports strongly typed or static typing feature.
2. Javascript is just a scripting language but typescript supports object-oriented programming concept like classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
3. Javascript directly run on the browser where typescript can't directly run on the browser.
4. Javascript source file is in ".js" extension where typescript source file is in ".ts" extension.
